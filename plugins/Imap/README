The IMAP plugin allows for StatusNet to check a POP or IMAP mailbox for
incoming mail containing user posts.

Installation
============
addPlugin('imap', array(
    'mailbox' => '...',
    'user' => '...',
    'password' => '...'
));
to the bottom of your config.php

Also, make sure:
$config['mail']['domain'] = 'yourdomain.example.net';
is set in your config.php

Create a catch-all account for your domain, and use this account with this
plugin. Whenever a user sends a message to their personal notice posting
address, the message should end up in this mailbox, and then the plugin daemon
will pick it up and post the notice on the user's behalf.

The daemon included with this plugin must be running. It will be started by
the plugin along with their other daemons when you run scripts/startdaemons.sh.
See the StatusNet README for more about queuing and daemons.

Settings
========
mailbox*: the mailbox specifier.
    See http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-open.php for details
user*: username to use when authenticating to the mailbox
