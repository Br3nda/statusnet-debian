The Minify plugin minifies your CSS and Javascript, removing whitespace and comments.

Note that if enabled this plugin and use a theme server,
    (if any of $config['theme']['server'], $config['theme']['path'],
    $config['theme']['dir'] are set) theme CSS will not be minified.

This plugin will use memcache, if it is available, for storing minified inline
    and file javascript and css. Because minification is non-trivial, using
    memcache is recommended.

Installation
============
add "addPlugin('minify',
    array('setting'=>'value', 'setting2'=>'value2', ...);"
to the bottom of your config.php

Settings
========
minifyInlineJs (true): Minify inline javascript.
    Because caching isn'tas effective for inline resources (due to its more
    dynamic nature) than static files, minifying inline resources may adversely
    affect performance for higher volume sites. Testing (and memcache usage)
    are highly recommended.
minifyInlineCss (true): Minify inline CSS.
    Because caching isn'tas effective for inline resources (due to its more
    dynamic nature) than static files, minifying inline resources may adversely
    affect performance for higher volume sites. Testing (and memcache usage)
    are highly recommended.

Example
=======

addPlugin('minify', array());
