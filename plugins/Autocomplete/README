Autocomplete allows users to autocomplete screen names in @ replies. When an "@" is typed into the notice text area, an autocomplete box is displayed populated with the user's friends' screen names.

Note: This plugin doesn't work if the site is in Private mode, i.e. when $config['site']['private'] is set to true.

Installation
============
Add "addPlugin('Autocomplete');" to the bottom of your config.php
That's it!
