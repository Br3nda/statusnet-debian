The Reverse Username Authentication plugin allows for StatusNet to handle authentication by checking if the provided password is the same as the reverse of the username.

THIS PLUGIN IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY

Installation
============
add "addPlugin('reverseUsernameAuthentication', array('setting'=>'value', 'setting2'=>'value2', ...);" to the bottom of your config.php

Settings
========
provider_name*: This is a identifier designated to the connection.
    It's how StatusNet will refer to the authentication source.
    For the most part, any name can be used, so long as each authentication source has a different identifier.
    In most cases there will be only one authentication source used.
password_changeable*: must be set to false. This plugin does not support changing passwords.
authoritative (false): Set to true if this plugin's responses are authoritative (meaning if this fails, do check any other plugins or the internal password database).
autoregistration (false): Set to true if users should be automatically created when they attempt to login.

* required
default values are in (parenthesis)

Example
=======
addPlugin('reverseUsernameAuthentication', array(
    'provider_name'=>'Example',
    'password_changeable'=>false,
    'authoritative'=>true,
    'autoregistration'=>true
));
