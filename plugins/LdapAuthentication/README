The LDAP Authentication plugin allows for StatusNet to handle authentication
through LDAP.

Installation
============
add "addPlugin('ldapAuthentication',
    array('setting'=>'value', 'setting2'=>'value2', ...);"
to the bottom of your config.php

Settings
========
provider_name*: This is a identifier designated to the connection.
    It's how StatusNet will refer to the authentication source.
    For the most part, any name can be used, so long as each authentication source has a different identifier.
    In most cases there will be only one authentication source used.
authoritative (false): Set to true if LDAP's responses are authoritative
    (if authorative and LDAP fails, no other password checking will be done).
autoregistration (false): Set to true if users should be automatically created
    when they attempt to login.
email_changeable (true): Are users allowed to change their email address?
    (true or false)
password_changeable (true): Are users allowed to change their passwords?
    (true or false)
password_encoding: required if users are to be able to change their passwords
    Possible values are: crypt, ext_des, md5crypt, blowfish, md5, sha, ssha,
        smd5, ad, clear

host*: LDAP server name to connect to. You can provide several hosts in an
    array in which case the hosts are tried from left to right.
