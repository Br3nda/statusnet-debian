%%site.name%% supports the [OpenID](http://openid.net/) standard for single signon between Web sites. OpenID lets you log into many different Web sites without using a different password for each. (See [Wikipedia's OpenID article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID) for more information.)

If you already have an account on %%site.name%%, you can [login](%%action.login%%) with your username and password as usual.
To use OpenID in the future, you can [add an OpenID to your account](%%action.openidsettings%%) after you have logged in normally.

There are many [Public OpenID providers](http://wiki.openid.net/OpenID-Providers), and you may already have an OpenID-enabled account on another service.

* On wikis: If you have an account on an OpenID-enabled wiki, like [Wikitravel](http://wikitravel.org/), [wikiHow](http://www.wikihow.com/), [Vinismo](http://vinismo.com/), [AboutUs](http://aboutus.org/) or [Keiki](http://kei.ki/), you can log in to %%site.name%% by entering the **full URL** of your user page on that other wiki in the box above. For example, *http://kei.ki/en/User:Evan*.
* [Yahoo!](http://openid.yahoo.com/) : If you have an account with Yahoo!, you can log in to this site by entering your Yahoo!-provided OpenID in the box above. Yahoo! OpenID URLs have the form *https://me.yahoo.com/yourusername*.
* [AOL](http://dev.aol.com/aol-and-63-million-openids) : If you have an account with [AOL](http://www.aol.com/), like an [AIM](http://www.aim.com/) account, you can log in to %%site.name%% by entering your AOL-provided OpenID in the box above. AOL OpenID URLs have the form *http://openid.aol.com/yourusername*. Your username should be all lowercase, no spaces.
* [Blogger](http://bloggerindraft.blogspot.com/2008/01/new-feature-blogger-as-openid-provider.html), [Wordpress.com](http://faq.wordpress.com/2007/03/06/what-is-openid/), [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/openid/about.bml), [Vox](http://bradfitz.vox.com/library/post/openid-for-vox.html) : If you have a blog on any of these services, enter your blog URL in the box above. For example, *http://yourusername.blogspot.com/*, *http://yourusername.wordpress.com/*, *http://yourusername.livejournal.com/*, or *http://yourusername.vox.com/*.
