StatusNet AutoSandbox plugin 0.1 03/16/10
=========================================
Automatically sandboxes newly registered users as a spam-management technique.
Only really suits small sites where all users can be hand-moderated. A moderator
will then have to unbox legimate users, using the following built-in script:

./scripts/userrole.php -n username -r moderator

(replace 'username' with the nickname of the user you wish to make a moderator).

The following note will be added to the top of the Registration form:

"Note you will initially be "sandboxed" so your posts will not appear in the
public timeline."

This can be followed by the following extra information if a contact user (denoted
here by XXX) is specified:

"Send a message to @XXX to speed up the unsandboxing process."

If no contact user is specified, it will default to the "Default subscription" user
who automatically subscribes to new users (set in Admin -> User).

Use:
1. Add plugin:

Default usage:
addPlugin('AutoSandbox');

Specify a contact user (replace 'someuser' with appropriate username):
addPlugin('AutoSandbox', array('contact' => 'someuser'));

Stop contact user from defaulting to the Defaul subscription:
addPlugin('AutoSandbox', array('contact' => ''));
